A simple and hopefully balanced meteorite spawner item for Terraria.

Adds an item called the Cosmic Radio to the game which drops a meteorite when used.

The Cosmic Radio has a 25% chance to drop from the Eater of Worlds and Brain of Cthulhu for normal mode. In expert mode the item will instead drop for their loot bags with the same odds. This will make it so that if you for some reason get extremely unlucky with meteorite spawns after killing the bosses you can still get a meteorite in your world.
